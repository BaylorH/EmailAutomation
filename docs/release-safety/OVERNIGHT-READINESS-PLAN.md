# Overnight production-readiness run — plan + live scorecard (2026-07-03 → 04)

**Goal:** by morning, an evidence-based verdict on bringing users back to production — every event, every dashboard interaction, and the messy ways brokers actually write, pressure-tested against the REAL logic, bugs found AND fixed, rubric gaps closed, scheduler advanced. Push to branches as progress lands.

**Why this run is different (not another "some progress" check-in):** it is goal-directed and convergent. Each surface runs **find → adversarially verify → fix (TDD) → prove (permanent test) → loop-until-dry**, and the run stops a surface only when N consecutive rounds find nothing new. Coverage is measured against the 10 readiness gates below, not "tests added."

## The readiness bar (scorecard — the actual verdict)
| # | Gate | State at start | Target |
|---|------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | Rubric green on Base-V1 (no borrowed greens) | 69/40/10 base; borrowed greens purged | 0 required needs_fixture on Base-V1 |
| 2 | 3 lanes (independent + integrated + full-campaign) real+passing | indep mostly; cross 2/8; campaign 0/9 | all 3 lanes real per base feature |
| 3 | Scheduler migrated to Firebase, lease intact | WS-B scaffold only | tested Cloud Run Job, dev-proven |
| 4 | Send-path invariants hold adversarially | strong (placeholder/recipient/tour/signature) | no phrasing breaks a guard |
| 5 | Golden campaign passes end-to-end, no code change mid-pass | not run (emulator blocked) | green on emulator/in-memory |
| 6 | Safety rails live (allowlist, caps, kill switch, dead-letter alert) | partial | all present + tested |
| 7 | Next-version isolated (Results/Tour/PDF/Map out of Base build) | WS-C done (flag + tree-shake) | ✅ pending review |
| 8 | Staging env (emulator or project) | emulator blocked (no JRE) | in-memory Firestore harness stood up |
| 9 | Observability (health can't lie; silent-drops emit evidence) | partial | verified |
| 10 | Rollback + runbook current | — | written |

## Input corpus — how brokers actually talk
Seeds: `feature-gradebook.eventVariantCatalog` (20 events × `sampleTriggers` × `nearMisses` × `stopIf`) + `combinationStressDecks` (8) + the real bp21 conversation threads (League City Golden Replay etc.). Each surface agent GENERATES many realistic phrasing variations per seed: terse / verbose / typo'd / partial / multi-intent / ambiguous / quoted-history / regional / attachment-only / conflicting-with-old-quote. Near-misses are the false-positive controls.

## What is testable locally vs. needs secrets
- **Local (the bulk):** every deterministic guard + handler + state transition + extraction application + reply-safety + `/api` route + conversation-panel contract. Driven via the proven Flask harness + `email_automation.*` with faked Firestore/Sheets/Graph. NO live sends. (venv: `scratchpad/bevenv`.)
- **Needs secrets (flagged, not blocking):** the LLM event-classification/extraction quality (OpenAI), real Graph/Sheets. Real-AI-in-the-loop pressure test runs only if an OpenAI key is provided; otherwise the LLM boundary is mocked with varied realistic proposals and the DOWNSTREAM handling is what gets hammered.

## Surfaces (worked in priority order, loop-until-dry each)
- **A — Guard & reply-safety robustness across broker-language variation + near-misses** (send-path invariants, gate 4). Placeholder / tour-leak / opt-out / wrong-contact / non-viable-vs-unavailable / reply-all-CC filtering / signature identity, each across many phrasings; near-miss = must-NOT-fire control. *(launching first)*
- **B — Property-extraction robustness** across spec formats ("$0.82 NNN" vs "82 cents triple net" vs partial vs attachment-only vs conflicting old quote) → `apply_proposal_to_sheet` (gates 1,4).
- **C — Dashboard interaction surface** — extend the token-auth + validation hardening to ALL mutating `/api` routes + the 7 `httpsCallable` functions + conversation-panel actions; fuzz each (gates 1,4,6).
- **D — State-permutation matrix** — every feature × every state (`statePermutations`) closes the base needs_fixture + stress gaps (gates 1,2).
- **E — Combination stress decks** — the 8 hard multi-feature scenarios → real integration tests (gate 2 integrated lane).
- **F — Full-campaign lifecycle** — in-memory Firestore double (no JRE) → chained upload→…→completion e2e (gates 2,5,8).
- **G — Scheduler migration** — finish WS-B Cloud Run Job using the legacy `.github/workflows/email.yml` (worked ~95%) as reference; lease + SIGTERM + dev-scope tested (gate 3).
- **H — Safety rails + observability + runbook** — recipient allowlist, daily caps, kill switch, dead-letter alerting, health-can't-lie check, rollback runbook (gates 6,9,10).

## Loop protocol (per cycle, overnight)
1. Read this scorecard; pick the highest-value surface with open gaps.
2. Run a find→verify→fix→prove workflow (fan-out; adversarial verify; loop-until-dry).
3. Integrate: real fixes committed (TDD), permanent tests added, rubric cells closed with honest provesBehavior.
4. **Push** the branch (authorized). Update this scorecard with evidence + bug counts.
5. Launch the next cycle (workflow completion re-invokes automatically; long fallback wake as backstop).
6. Stop when all 10 gates are green with evidence, or morning — then write the go/no-go verdict.

## Branches (push authorized)
- `codex/prod-v1-rubric-integrity-20260702` (rubric + lanes)
- `codex/backend-contract-hardening-20260703` (/api hardening + fuzz — extend here for surface C)
- `codex/frontend-api-token-auth-20260703` (frontend token)
- new per-surface branches as needed; keep each coherent.

## Hard rules (unchanged)
TDD; adversarially verify every case; NEVER fake a green — if a cell can't be honestly proven, document the reason/bug. No live email except bp21harrison@gmail.com ↔ baylor.freelance@outlook.com. No deploy / no reopening users without Baylor. The final real Jill-style end-to-end campaign is the LAST checkpoint, after the bar is green.
